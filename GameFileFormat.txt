# Format:
# Comma-delimited
# Object type,x,y,[any other variables...]
# e.g. for platforms, would have width,height too
#			collectibles might have point value
#			player might have flags for walking/dashing, jumping/falling/neither, current item, health
#			could also have flag for triggered halfway checkpoint, true/false

# x's and y's should be relative to the beginning of the level

# so something like:

Platform,0,0,500,10
Collectible,75,20,5
Player,325,360,dash,fall,knife,4
