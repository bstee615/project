# Platforms 'n' Pictographs
This was the final result of a team project for CpS209, C++ programming. I worked on this project with Zac Hayes, Carter Shean, and Andrew Price. This was also really the first big application that I worked on, so it's nostalgic for me. I worked on the enemy movement logic, player animations, and powerups, and assisted with other parts of the game.
